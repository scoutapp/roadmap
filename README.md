# Scout Roadmap

This is the public product roadmap for [Scout](https://scoutapp.com), application monitoring that developers ‚ù§Ô∏è. 

How this works:

* Review existing suggestions and ideas via [issues](https://github.com/scoutapp/roadmap/issues).
* If you're interested an issue, give it a üëç. We'll update progress on the issue.
* If you don't see your idea, create a new issue.
* We label ideas we're working on as "in progress". We typically don't provide ETAs until an issue nears completion.
* We label ideas we're planning on starting as "soon".

## Monitoring agents
