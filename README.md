# Scout Roadmap

This is the public product roadmap for [Scout](https://scoutapp.com), application monitoring that developers ‚ù§Ô∏è. 

How this works:

* Review existing suggestions and ideas via [issues](https://github.com/scoutapp/roadmap/issues).
* If you're interested an issue, give it a üëç. We'll update progress on the issue and mention you when the feature is ready.
* If you don't see your idea, create a new issue.
* Issue progression is done via labels:
  * `soon` - work will begin shortly.
  * `in progress` - we've started work.
  * `tech preview` - the issue is available with rough edges
* When an issue is polished, we'll close it.
